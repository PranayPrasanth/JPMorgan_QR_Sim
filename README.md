## Project Overview

The **JPMorgan Chase Quantitative Research Simulation** is designed to expose participants to real-world challenges faced by quantitative analysts in a financial institution. This project involved developing analytical models and performing statistical analyses on simulated financial datasets to address problems in asset valuation and risk management.

## Tasks Completed

### Task 1: Natural Gas Price Forecasting

**Objective:** Forecast future natural gas prices using time series analysis.

**Methodology:**
- Loaded and preprocessed historical natural gas price data, handling date conversions and missing values.
- Trained an **ARIMA(2,1,2)** model to capture trends and seasonality.
- Forecasted gas prices up to 12 months into the future.

**Key Outcome:** A robust time series forecasting model capable of predicting future gas prices.

---

### Task 2: Gas Storage Contract Pricing

**Objective:** Price a hypothetical natural gas storage contract.

**Methodology:**
- Simulated cash flows for injection and withdrawal periods.
- Considered parameters like market prices, storage limits, injection/withdrawal rates, and daily storage costs.
- Aggregated cash flows and costs to value the contract.

**Key Outcome:** A working financial model to value gas storage derivatives under operational constraints.

---

### Task 3: Credit Default Prediction & Expected Loss

**Objective:** Build a model to predict loan default and calculate Expected Loss (EL).

**Methodology:**
- Preprocessed and standardized simulated loan data.
- Trained a **Logistic Regression** model to estimate Probability of Default (PD).
- Calculated **Expected Loss (EL)** using the formula:  
  `EL = PD Ã— LGD Ã— EAD`

**Key Outcome:** A predictive model for credit risk assessment and expected loss calculation.

---

### Task 4: FICO Score Bucketing Methodologies

**Objective:** Explore and compare methodologies for FICO score bucketing.

**Methodology:**
- **MSE-Based Bucketing:** Used K-Means clustering to minimize intra-cluster variance.
- **Log-Likelihood Optimization:** Used `scipy.optimize.minimize` to optimize bucket boundaries based on log-likelihood of defaults.
- Assigned credit ratings to buckets for risk categorization.

**Key Outcome:** Comparative analysis of credit score segmentation for improved risk stratification.
